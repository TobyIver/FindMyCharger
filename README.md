# FindMyCharger
MCTC Android class final 

This app records a GPS coordinate every time you unplug the phone from being charged.  It does this in the background and can be called up if you misplaced a charger or to find your car.
It senses the charged state then access the GPs and records the time.  Once the app is opened it lists the last few locations. Click on one and it will open the location in maps.

The app is not consumer ready.  Ideally the app would open in the background when your phone starts up.  Haven't found a way to do that over a variety of devices.  

All the code and folders are here to open in Android Studio.
